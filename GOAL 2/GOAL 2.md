This .ipynb file contains a mini baseball data analytics project that analyzes WAR and ERA trends for a specific baseball player. 
The file utilizes pandas and numpy and the pybaseball libraries to extract data from a baseball data. I filtered null values within the data and for pitchers who have only pitched at least 150 innings from any season from 2002 to 2023. It then uses matplotlib to plot a graph that plots a trend of graph of their WAR and ERA.
This completes my 3rd goal because it shows use of data analytics libraries from python within the application of baseball statistics.
