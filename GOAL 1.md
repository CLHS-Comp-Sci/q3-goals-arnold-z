The .ipynb contains all the code, results, and summary of results for the GPT-4o mini. 
The code utilizes each problem within the GSM-8K dataset, generates various answers from GPT-4o with varying certainty in the prompts and compares it to the actual answer to calculate an accuracy score.
Since our goal was to explore a third model, we chose GPT-4o mini and our code does effectively evaluate its performance on the math problems provided through the GSM-8K dataset.
